Java-Projects
=============
This project was created as part of an assignment for my second semester of learning Java at Brandeis University.
It is an original game created using the Greenfoot API, and requires a downloaded copy of Greenfoot to run.
The background image is NOT my property, and will likely be replaced soon.
All other image and sound assets were taken from open source sites.
